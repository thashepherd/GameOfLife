GameOfLife_0: The Android Game Of Life Tutorial

This is a 'lightly hacked' version of a game of Life found on the internet.

The original version is from the web site
http://www.quesucede.com/page/show/id/conway_game_of_life_android
which was last referenced on 11/21/2012 by bks.

Since the tutorial is old (2010) and uses Android API level 7.
If you try to import into a newer eclipse with the Android 4 plugins,
you will get a faulty project; the build path libraries are not correct.

These notes provide a way to create a new, Android 4.x eclipse project
in which you can build and run the tutorial as it was published but
under an updated Android API level.

Steps to make and run the project from the original eclipse project:

1. Create an 'empty' Android 4 project

Use eclipse > new Android Project.
Set the android version to 14, 15 or 16; these are Android 4.0.
Set source path to match tutorial's original: com.quesucede.gameoflife
Uncheck the box: DO NOT create an Activity class.

The created project will have these files:
    - project.properties
    - AndroidManifest.xml now has the setting for api level minimum.


2. Import the original project from the web site

Download original eclipse project tutorial and unpack in a temporary place.
    Let's call that place <original>.

Import these items from the original tutorial:
    
    - Import the java source files from the original directory.
    Select the src directory, right-click, and choose import...
    The files come from <original>/src/com/quesucede/gameoflife.
    
    - **Import the AndroidManifest.xml for info on what to launch; otherwise
    AndroidManifest.xml to specify the main activity.

    - From outside of eclipse, manually copy the <original>/res/ content 
    into project's ./res/ directory.
    - Refresh project to eliminate errors reported from external imports.

Do a Project >> Clean and rebuild to remake everything fresh.

3. Create a run configuration for launching the main activity.

    You need to have previously created an AVD emulator for testing.
    Run the app on the AVD emulator.

**Note: GameOfLife_0 needed to add the setting for api level requirement to 
    AndroidManifest.xml because it initially imported that file from the
    tutorial. (web search: specify android API level requirement for a how-to)
